<h2>Overview and Error Analysis</h2>
<p>Numerical methods formed the core of my recent computational mathematics research. This work spanned a wide array of techniques crucial for tackling complex mathematical problems in digital environments. A significant portion of my effort was dedicated to understanding and mitigating errors inherent in computer-based calculations, particularly those arising from truncation and the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.</p>

<h2>Matrix Operations and Linear Systems</h2>
<p>Matrix operations were a key focus, with implementations ranging from direct solving methods like Gaussian elimination to more nuanced approaches such as Crout and Doolittle LU decomposition variants. Parallel to this, I explored iterative techniques for approximating solutions to linear systems, including Gauss-Seidel, Gauss-Jacobi, and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) methods. Each approach was rigorously tested for convergence speed and computational efficiency.</p>

<h2>Root-Finding and Function Approximation</h2>
<p>The quest for roots of equations led me to implement and compare various algorithms, among them Regula-Falsi, Newton-Raphson, Secant, and fixed-point iteration. These were scrutinized for their accuracy and convergence behavior across diverse scenarios. Function approximation techniques also featured prominently in my work, with a focus on polynomial interpolation methods like Hermite interpolation, as well as linear and cubic spline approaches. These proved invaluable for reconstructing continuous functions from discrete data points.</p>

<h2>Numerical Integration and Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rounding out my research were investigations into numerical integration, primarily utilizing Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules. These methods were evaluated for their ability to accurately compute definite integrals while maintaining computational efficiency. Through this comprehensive exploration, I gained a nuanced understanding of each method's strengths and limitations, enhancing my ability to select and apply optimal techniques for varied mathematical challenges in scientific and engineering domains.</p>
